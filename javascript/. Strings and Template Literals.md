📌 First: The Problem with the Old Way of String Concatenation

In the past, we used the + operator to join strings together (this is called concatenation).

Example:
```js
let firstName = "Jonas";
let job = "teacher";
let birthYear = 1991;
let year = 2037;

let jonas = "I'm " + firstName + ", a " + job + " aged " + (year - birthYear) + " years old!";

console.log(jonas);
```
❗ Problems with This Approach

You need to use + many times

You must carefully manage spaces " "

You must wrap calculations in parentheses

The code looks messy and harder to read

📌 Why Do We Use Parentheses Here?
(year - birthYear)


Because we want the subtraction to happen before the string concatenation.

If we don’t use parentheses, the result may be incorrect due to operator precedence.

📌 Type Coercion

When you do this:
```js
"I'm " + 46
```

JavaScript automatically converts the number 46 into a string so it can join it with "I'm ".

This automatic conversion is called:

Type Coercion

🚀 The Better Solution: Template Literals

Starting from ES6, we have a much better way to build strings called:

Template Literals

Instead of using single ' ' or double " " quotes, we use backticks:

`

📌 The Modern Version
```js
let firstName = "Jonas";
let job = "teacher";
let birthYear = 1991;
let year = 2037;

let jonasNew = `I'm ${firstName}, a ${job} aged ${year - birthYear} years old!`;

console.log(jonasNew);
```
🔥 What Changed?

We used backticks `

We used ${} to insert variables

Inside ${}, we can write any JavaScript expression

Example:

${year - birthYear}


That’s a full calculation inside the string.

📌 Why Is This Better?

✅ No more +
✅ No space confusion
✅ Cleaner code
✅ Easier to read
✅ More professional

📌 Multi-line Strings
❌ Old Way:
```js
console.log("String with\n\
multiple\n\
lines");
```

We had to use:

\n → new line

\ → to continue the line

Messy and annoying.

✅ Modern Way:

```js
console.log(`String
with
multiple
lines`);
```

Just press Enter inside backticks 😍

Much cleaner.

📌 Important Note

You can use backticks for any normal string, even if you don’t need ${}:

let name = `Moaaz`;


Many developers prefer using backticks all the time.

🎯 Summary
Old Way	Modern Way
+ concatenation	Template literals
Messy	Clean
Needs parentheses	Direct expressions
Harder to read	Very readable
