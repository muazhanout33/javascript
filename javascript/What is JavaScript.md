1️⃣ What is JavaScript?

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, object-oriented, multi-paradigm programming language.

Let’s break that down:

a) Programming Language

Any programming language is a tool that lets us write code to tell a computer what to do.

With JS, our goal is to control websites or applications in the browser.

b) High-Level

This means JS hides complex things like memory management.

There’s abstraction, meaning the computer handles the small details, and we focus on writing code.

This makes JS easier to learn and write.

c) Object-Oriented

JS is built around objects to store data.

Objects can have properties (data) and methods (actions).

Example:

const car = {
  color: "red",
  brand: "Toyota",
  drive: function() { console.log("Driving"); }
};

d) Multi-Paradigm

JS is flexible and allows different programming styles.

Examples:

Imperative (step-by-step instructions)

Declarative (tell the computer what you want and it figures out how)

2️⃣ JavaScript in Web Development

JS works together with HTML and CSS:

a) HTML

Handles content: text, images, buttons.

Example: <p>Hello World</p> → <p> is the paragraph (noun), "Hello World" is the content.

b) CSS

Handles style and layout: colors, fonts, positioning.

Example: p { color: red; } → “red” describes the paragraph.

c) JavaScript

Handles interaction and dynamics:

Show/hide elements

Load data from servers

Build full web applications

d) Analogy: Grammar

HTML = nouns → the things

CSS = adjectives → describe things

JS = verbs → actions we do with things

3️⃣ Real Example: Twitter

When opening a profile: loading spinners appear.

JS fetches data from the server.

After data loads, JS hides the spinners and shows the content.

Clicking "Tweet" shows the tweet box and hides it when clicking outside.

Hovering over a user shows info dynamically.

Lesson: All dynamic effects are powered by JS.

4️⃣ JS Beyond Browsers

JS can also run outside the browser using Node.js:

Lets you create backend applications that interact with databases.

In the browser, we create front-end applications (what we do in this course).

JS can also build mobile apps (React Native, Ionic) and desktop apps (Electron).

5️⃣ Modern JavaScript

The big update in 2015: ES2015 or ES6.

There are yearly updates after that.

Modern JS = the latest features used today.

Important: learn JS well before learning frameworks like React, Angular, or Vue.

Being strong in JS makes it easier to learn any new tool.

6️⃣ Summary

JS lets us add interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites.

You can build full web apps, mobile apps, desktop apps, and backend apps.

Learning JS properly is the key to modern web development.
